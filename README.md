# Talk on LLVM and Clang tooling at C++Now 2017

Notes on modifications:

- Picture of god/jesus (giving power to people)
- Clangd
- Picture of either shaman/conjuring up stuff or throwing dragon in cauldron
- Definitely show more of the code (lexer -> Lexer.h, Sema.h, TemplateDeduction.h) and Doxygen (for Stmt, Decl, Type)
